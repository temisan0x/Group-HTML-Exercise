# Group HTML Project - Blockfuse Labs

This is where we work together collaboratively to practice semantic HTML tags.

## What We're Doing

- Each of us will use at least 7 semantic HTML tags, including `<header>` and `<footer>`.
- Create your HTML file on your local machine and then share it here.

## Steps to Contribute

**Clone Our Repo:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/temisan0x/Group-HTML-Exercise.git
